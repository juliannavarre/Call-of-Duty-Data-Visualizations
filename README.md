# Call-of-Duty-Data-Visualizations

The PDF (CoD Tableau Visualization Project Julian N) has everything you need!


The purpose of this personal project was to further enhance my Tableau skills. During the winter
break, I had planned on taking a random dataset and using it for practice in Tableau. One day
while playing Modern Warfare, I questioned whether it was beneficial for players to use UAV or
personal radar. Whenever I asked myself this question, the idea to create a survey and ask
players for their input came to mind. Instead of working with a random dataset to practice my
visualization skills, I decided that I could make this my project and work with something that I
really find interesting. I originally created a Twitter (@AnalyticsCod) to ask random users who
hash tagged #ModernWarfare to take my survey. While the survey was in progress, I thought it
would also be a great idea to try SurveyMonkey and post the survey on Reddit. The pictures
below show the questions that were asked, data visualizations created by Tableau, and the
analysis of the data.
